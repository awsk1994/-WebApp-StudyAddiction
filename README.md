 -> right now, the layers (of tables with different colors) overlap everytime there is a new json data sent via socket io. Need to fix it so it replaces or clears before adding more layers each time a new json file comes in.
 -> you can use localhost:3000/test1.html to intercept messages via socket io between host and client, or simply type table id to change the table color.
