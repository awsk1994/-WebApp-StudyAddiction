\f0\b\fs38 \cf0 Proposed Group/Website Name:\

\b0 Group Name: StudyAddicts.\
Application Name: \'93StudyAddiction\'94\
\

\b Proposed Idea:
\b0 \
Our web application aims to provide a service to our users by informing them of free tables to study at a given University. A big issue with this web application idea is detecting free tables. To solve this, this web application will take advantage of \'91User Morality\'92. It was inspired by Waze, a GPS app, whereby users would notify other users of traffics, police speed checks and other hazards/issues by posting the information onto the app. The app will in turn take the information and present it on the map to notify other Waze users. Waze users are rewarded by a loyalty system for doing this, but most importantly, it is using \'91user morality\'92 that by helping others, they will eventually help you back.\
Our web application will be doing a similar job. Users will be able to inform other users of free tables like Waze does it. \
\

\b Target Audience:\

\b0 For this prototype, we are targeting University of Rochester students. In the future, we may expand to other campuses or expand out of simply the purpose of \'91finding free tables in libraries\'92.\
\

\b Problem it intends to solve for audience?\

\b0 Often, especially during periods of mid-term and final exams, students spend a long time finding tables to study in the library. The problem is not that there are not enough tables for students to study, but rather, students do not know where the free tables are. As a result, students either end up wasting time finding seats or they end up putting their belongings on tables to reserve the table despite knowing that they won\'92t be coming back for hours.\
Therefore, this web application aims to inform users of free tables to lessen their time in finding a table, and hopefully discourage students to take up tables they know they won\'92t be using for hours.\
\

\b How will it meet the minimum project requirements?\

\b0 Users will have to create accounts in order to use this web application. This is so we can keep track of users who are being \'91nice\'92 (providing accurate data) and users who are always giving \'91false data\'92. Since the user has to fetch information (free tables), it definitely has to fetch data from the server and present it on a webpage. Additionally, users will be able to update their data, or delete their own account. \
Lastly, the interface will look like a Google map with indications of free or non-free tables. This will have to happen without reloading the webpage, and thus, AJAX will have to be used.\
\

\b Why is your proposed web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?\

\b0 Applications or Ideas regarding to \'91finding free tables to study in the library\'92 is not something new. However, University of Rochester does not currently have this, and thus, it is regarded new if we do eventually provide this service to University of Rochester students. \
In terms of functionality, this is creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements because we are taking advantage of the ability to store user data to implement a reward/reputation system. Using AJAX, we are also updating information almost instantly. Lastly, we are using these technologies to provide something of value to our users.\
